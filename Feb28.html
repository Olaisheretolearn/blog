                                  This afternoon, I sat at my desk trying to figure out why my TaskRequest DTO wasn’t being 
                                  recognized. I had named it TaskCreateRequest in the actual code.
                                   Minor mistake, but it stopped me cold and genuinely made me pause my music <br> <br> 

                                    

                                    <br> <br> 

                                    Most of today went into building the Task entity. You know , following the same Interface Metaphor idea, i wanted to name it Chores , more homely , but i actually ironically have a trouble with typing that quickly
                                    So we need to be able to arrange tasks or make tasks , or even delete tasks  i.e  "mop the floor" , the satate of the task , Who did a specific tasjk , you know , these details
                                    Tasks are the reason the shared space stays sane — or doesn’t.
<br> <br>
                                    
          <div style="width:70%; height:0%; padding-bottom:55%; position:relative;">
  <img src="images/image-6.png" alt="ERD image" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover; border-radius:9px;">
</div>
                                  
    
                               <div class="datap">

                             I gave each task a name, a description, a due date, and some logic around recurrence 
                             and completion. More importantly, it can be assigned to someone — though 
                             I had to remind myself that not every task starts off with an owner. 
                             So assignedTo needed to be nullable. Took me a second to realize that.

                    <br> <br>              <div style="width:100%; height:0%; padding-bottom:55%; position:relative;">
  <img src="images/image-7.png" alt="ERD image" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover; border-radius:9px;">
</div>

                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    I added the usual DTOs: TaskCreateRequest to receive stuff, TaskResponse to send stuff back, TaskUpdateRequest to edit a task. Basic in structure, a task handed over, and a task reported done.
                                    <br><br>
                                  At one point, I tried parsing a string into an Instant for the due date and blanked. I knew it was something like Instant.parse(...) but I just wasn’t sure if that was enough. Spoiler: it was. 
                                  But it took asking for help to confirm.
                                    </p>

                                <br><br>
                               I also wrote a repository method to find tasks by name. And then I realized — what even is a unique task name? Every room on the planet has a “Take out trash” or “Clean bathroom” on repeat. So I’m rethinking that approach. 
                               Maybe search by room ID, maybe by both name and who it’s assigned to.
