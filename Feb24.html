                                    This article assumes that you as a reader have some prerequisite knowledge of the Big O notation, We will quickly summarize below what Big O is before we actually move to why we need to drop the constants 
                                    <br> <br>

                                    Sometimes, a program might feel slow, and you might wonder if it's because the program isn't written well 
                                    or if the job it's doing is just really tough. 
                                    These questions help us think about how hard the problem is and which method might be better for solving it.  <br> <br> 

                                    In computer science, understanding the efficiency of algorithms is paramount. 
                                    A key concept in this analysis is Big O notation, which measures the time and space complexity of algorithms as 
                                    input size increases.
                                     This article delves into the role of constants in Big O notation and why they are often disregarded in calculations

                                                Big O notation helps us understand the efficiency of algorithms by measuring their time and space complexity. 
                                                It's all about figuring out how an algorithm's performance scales as the input size increases.

                                    Now, let's turn our attention to constants and their significance in Big O notation.
                                     At first glance, constants might seem important, but when considering 
                                     the bigger picture of scalability, their impact diminishes. To illustrate this point, imagine two algorithms: one that processes 10 items in 5 seconds, and another that processes 100 items in 50 seconds. It might be tempting to assume the first algorithm is more efficient due to its lower processing time for a smaller input. However, this assumption overlooks the crucial aspect of scalability.

                                <br> <br>
                                The truth is, constants do not influence the overall growth rate of an algorithm. 
                                While they may affect performance with smaller inputs, they become irrelevant when 
                                dealing with large datasets. This is why constants are typically ignored when calculating 
                                Big O notation, as the primary goal is to determine an algorithm's growth rate and its ability to 
                                handle large volumes of data. </li>

                                I largely love Operating Systems, and OOP and this blog will be mainly about these stuff

                                really knows his stuff! Another favorite of mine is delving into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                                 through the insights of Dr. Tom Butler <a href="https://r.je" style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">here</a> a professor from the University of Northampton.
                                 These reads add some serious depth to my understanding, and I always find myself coming back for more! ðŸ“–âœ¨
