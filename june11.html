                                   Hi , my name is Ola and i am an Undergraduate of Applied Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">University Of Winnipeg</a>

                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    Currently, I got this 9-5 thing that's not exactly about coding,
                                     but hey, we all gotta do something, right?
                                    </p>
    
                               <div class="datap">

                                I currently hold the position of a webmaster for the Nigerian chapter of EGM (Engineers based in Manitoba), before that , I was a Technical support representative for Paramount+
                               
                                

                                <br> <br>
                                During the daily  of 9-5 grind , I'm doing my thing. But as soon as the clock sets me free, it's computer time
                                 I love tinkering around and making cool stuff </li>
                                <br> <br>

                                I also love to play music -The piano and the guitar, Please don't ask me if I am any good, 
                                I also love to read random literatures, <br> <br> I started this blog to share my enthusiasm for the science around computers and programming 
,
                                I largely love Operating Systems, and OOP and this blog will be mainly about these stuff
                                <br> <br>
                             
                                I'm a big fan of reading articles shared by Yegor Bugayenko <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/" style="font-weight: bold; color: black; display: flex; flex-direction: row;">here</a>- that guy 
                                really knows his stuff! Another favorite of mine is delving into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                                 through the insights of Dr. Tom Butler <a href="https://r.je" style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">here</a> a professor from the University of Northampton.
                                 These reads add some serious depth to my understanding, and I always find myself coming back for more! ðŸ“–âœ¨

                                        By the way, you're welcome to read my thoughts! I'll be mostly diving into the world of OOP and operating Systems, and just a heads up, I try my best to get things right. But hey, we're all human, right? If you ever spot something fishy or
                                         just wanna chat, shoot me an email at oke-o59@webmail.uwinnipeg.ca. I'm all ears (or, you know, eyes)! ðŸš€

                                 Looking forward to the possibility of diving into more exciting projects together!
