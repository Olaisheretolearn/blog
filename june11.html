                                    Hey there! ðŸŒŸ I'm from Nigeria but right now, I'm chilling in Canada, learning cool stuff about computers. 
                                    So, I got this 9-5 thing that's not exactly about coding, but hey, we all gotta do something, right?

                                During the daily grind of 9-5, I'm doing my thing. But as soon as the clock sets me free, it's computer time
                                 I love tinkering around and making cool stuff </li>

                                I'm a big fan of reading articles shared by Yegor Bugayenko <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/" style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">here</a>- that guy 
                                really knows his stuff! Another favorite of mine is delving into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                                 through the insights of Dr. To Butler <a href="https://r.je" style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">here</a>, a professor from the University of Northampton.
                                 These reads add some serious depth to my understanding, and I always find myself coming back for more! ðŸ“–âœ¨

                                But what happens when the primary system is back in action? Well, that's where failback comes into the picture. 
                                Just like when the electricity returns, and the generator switches off, 
                                failback ensures a smooth transition back to the primary system once it's resolved. 
                                It's a seamless process that happens behind the scenes, allowing users to enjoy uninterrupted services.

                                        By the way, welcome to read my thoughts! I'll be mostly diving into the world of OOP, and just a heads up, I try my best to get things right. But hey, we're all human, right? If you ever spot something fishy or
