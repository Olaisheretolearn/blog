    So, something funny happened the other day. A friend searched my name on Google and, to my surprise, pictures of me popped up. Not just any pictures, but ones I had deleted from LinkedIn ages ago. I thought I had erased those awkward photos for good, but there they were, in all their cringy glory. How? Why? What is this sorcery?
                               <div class="datap">

                           

                                <br> <br>
                                Turns out, Google has this thing called a web crawler. It's like a little internet robot that zooms around the web, checking out new pages and saving copies of them. These copies are called cached versions. So even if you delete something, Google might still have a backup of it. Thanks, Google. Really appreciate it.
                                <br> <br>

                                Anyway, this got me thinking. If Google can cache pages from LinkedIn, maybe it does the same for other websites. You know, the ones with annoying paywalls? Most websites want to show up in Google search results, so they let the web crawler in. And bingo! The crawler saves 
                                a version of the page that isn't paywalled. <br> <br> 


                                Here’s where it gets interesting. I realized I could access these cached versions and read the full articles without paying a dime. Just a little trick I stumbled upon in my quest to find my lost photos.
                                <br> <br>
                                
                                But there's a catch. As soon as the cached page loads, it quickly updates and throws the paywall back in my face. Talk about frustrating! But I found a way around that too. All I had to do was disable JavaScript. Sounds technical, but it's super easy. Just go to your browser settings, find the JavaScript option, and turn it off.



                                <br> <br>
                                And voila! The paywalled page stays open, letting me read all the juicy details. It's like finding a hidden treasure chest on the internet.
