                            </div>

                                    <div class="data">
                                <p class="datap">
                                    A few hours into writing the Room model, I realized 
                                     I was literally  describing a household. like the shape of shared space
                               <div class="datap">
                                <br> 
                                There’s a concept in HCI called an interface metaphor. 
                                It’s when you design something in code that mimics how things work in real life, 
                                so people don’t have to re-learn everything from scratch
                                <br> <br>
                               Anyways, So I thought- what would a household have? . at least , THIS type of household
                                <br>  <br>
                             Well, it would have a name. Most houses don’t, but this one needs to, It would have an owner or overseer. Someone who started the space and feels a tiny bit responsible for it,It would have members. It also would have a key, something like an invite code.
                              And finally, it would have a timestamp. (dont ask me what the equivalent of that is)

                                <br> <br> 
                                So I wrote this: 

                    
                                <div style="width:100%; height:0; padding-bottom:55%; position:relative;">
  <img src="images/image-1.png" alt="ERD image" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover;">
</div>

<br> <br>
Each room has an ownerId (the user who created it), and a list of memberIds. 
A room doesn’t exist in isolation someone starts it, and others are invited in. 
The inviteCode is like  a key. I didn’t want it to be random long gibberish id,
 so I wrote a short utility:

      <div class="box">
                                    <div class="verse">
                                    <i>
                                        <code>fun generateInviteCode(length: Int = 6): String { <br> 
    val chars = ('a'..'z') + ('0'..'9') <br>
    return (1..length).map { chars.random() }.joinToString("") <br>
}
</code>
                                    </i>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>
      

                                <br> <br>
Readable. Shareable
<br> <br>
Before wiring up the service layer, I created a RoomRepository that extends MongoRepository with one query method " findByCode" .

<br> <br>
Room Creation & Join Flow:
I wrote the RoomService to handle the logic of: <br>

    ->creating a room, <br>

    ->generating a unique invite code, <br>

    ->adding the creator as the owner and first member. <br> <br>

When someone else joins using the invite code, the flow:<br>

    ->fetches the room by code,<br>

    ->checks if the user is already a member,<br>

    ->appends them to the memberIds,<br>

    ->updates their roomId field in the User collection.<br>

                                
                         
                                
                              <br> <br>
                              Catch you in the part 2 lol
                                

                               <br>
                               
                             


                                
                                        
                                   
                                            
                                             
                            <hr>

        </section>   
        
        <script>
            const darkModeToggle = document.getElementById('dark-mode-toggle');
            const darkModeStylesheet = document.getElementById('dark-mode-stylesheet');
        
            darkModeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
                const isDarkModeEnabled = darkModeStylesheet.disabled;
                darkModeStylesheet.disabled = !isDarkModeEnabled;
            });
