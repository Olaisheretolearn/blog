                                <p class="datap">Welcome welcome welcome to the first episode of the List series, Where we will be talking about the List Abstract Data type, from data data Structures 
                                    that implement the List ADT to writing them ourselves

                                   <br> <br> 
                                   I will try my best not to miss any point, chances are if you are reading this, You know me and just text me or call me and we will figure it out together, You are probably already like "Can this guy just stfu and let's get to the List ADT you promised me"
                                    hey, my bad let's get it

                                    Honestly, I believe we all have an intuitive understanding of what a list is already ( if you don't, chances are English is not your first language). 
                                    We just want to turn this "intuitive understanding" into a concrete  data structure, 
                                    </p>

                                        just in case - A list is a number of items written
      consecutively, one after the other, or below another, for example
   Grocery List , song  Playlist(this one even has a list in the name), 
   A list of people that have offended you ( abeg now, forgive them)
                                    </i>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>
                                

                                <br> <br>
                                Technically, A list is said to be a finite, ordered sequence of data items known as elements 
                                 - close to the definition of a sequence in mathematics  </li>
                                <br> <br>

                                 
                                <div class="box">
                                    <div class="verse">
                                    <i>
                                        finite - having limits or   bounds  i.e We  know the end 
                                    </i>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>


                                    The most important concept in the list is positions, In order words we perceive a list to have a first element,
                                     a second ........ n -1, n elements ( n being the last element);
                                      <br> <br>
                                      ‚ÄúOrdered‚Äù in this definition means that each element has a position in the list. So the term ‚Äúordered‚Äù in this context does not mean that the list elements are sorted by value. (Of course, we can always choose to sort the elements on the list if we want;
                                       it‚Äôs just that keeping the elements sorted is not an inherent property of being a list.) 
                                       <br> <br>
                                       
                                       now let's go a little deeper - <i class="comment">That was what she said</i>

                                Each list must have some data type, you do not put a podcast in a music playlist, hey now you can, if you're a pychopath 



                                <br> <br>
                                In this series, we will be using Java generics, 
                                so go get your knowledge up!, so in a list,  
                                all elements of the list are usually assumed to have the same data type, 
                                although there is no conceptual objection to lists whose elements have differing 
                                data types if the application requires it. 

    
                                <br> <br>
                                A list is said to be empty when it contains no elements. The number of elements currently stored is called the length of the list. 
                                The beginning of the list is called the head , the end of the list is called the tail .  (reference)

                                         just wanna chat, shoot me an email at oke-o59@webmail.uwinnipeg.ca. I'm all ears (or, you know, eyes)! üöÄ

                                 Looking forward to the possibility of diving into more exciting projects together!
