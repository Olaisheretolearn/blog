                                    that implement the List ADT to writing them ourselves

                                   <br> <br> 
                                   I will try my best not to miss any point, chances are if you are reading this, You know me and just text me or call me and we will figure it out together, You are probably already like "Can this guy just stfu and let's get to the List ADT you promised me"
                                    hey, my bad let's get it 


                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    Honestly, I believe we all have an intuitive understanding of what a list is already ( if you don't, chances are English is not your first language). 
                                    We just want to turn this "intuitive understanding" into a concrete  data structure,

                                        just in case - A list is a number of items written
      consecutively, one after the other, or below another, for example
   Grocery List , song  Playlist(this one even has a list in the name), 
   A list of people that have offended you ( abeg now, forgive them)
                                    </i>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>
                                

                                <br> <br>
                                Technically, A list is said to be a finite, ordered sequence of data items known as elements 
                                 - close to the definition of a sequence in mathematics  </li>
                                <br> <br>

                                 
                                <div class="box">
                                    <div class="verse">
                                    <i>
                                        finite - having limits or   bounds  i.e We  know the end 
                                    </i>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>


                                    The most important concept in the list is <i class="comment">positions</i>, In order words we perceive a list to have a first element,
                                     a second ........ n -1, n elements ( n being the last element);
                                      <br> <br>
                                      “Ordered” in this definition means that each element has a position in the list. So the term “ordered” in this context does not mean that the list elements are sorted by value. (Of course, we can always choose to sort the elements on the list if we want;
                                       it’s just that keeping the elements sorted is not an inherent property of being a list.) 
                                       <br> <br>

                                       now let's go a little deeper -<i class="comment">That was what she said</i>

                                
                                <br> <br>
                             
                                Each list must have some data type, you do not put a podcast in a music playlist, hey now you can, if you're a pychopath 



                                <br> <br>
                                In this series, we will be using Java generics, 
                                so go get your knowledge up!, so in a list,  
                                all elements of the list are usually assumed to have the same data type, 
                                although there is no conceptual objection to lists whose elements have differing 
                                data types if the application requires it. 

    
                                <br> <br>
                                A list is said to be empty when it contains no elements. The number of elements currently stored is called the length of the list. 
                                The beginning of the list is called the head , the end of the list is called the tail .  (reference)

                                <i class="comment">but before we go ahead talking about lists, let's talk about the List ADT</i>

                                <br> <br>
                                <h4>The List ADT</h4> 
                                <h6> <i> What is an interface ?</i> </h6>
                                <i class="comment">Quick Story</i> <br> <br>
                                I was talking to a friend about how you can buy <a href="https://example.com">jollof rice</a>
                                in a Nigerian Domino pizza, you laugh but it's true, 
                                You can have fried plantain as a topping, you also laugh but it's true (somewhat)

                                <br> <br>
                                Now Dominos as we know it is a Franchise, that when you want to open a Domino's Pizza  anywhere in the world
                                 ( don't fact-check me on this  please ) or Say 7eleven 
                                <br> <br>
                                You will have to make an application to 7eleven about this, after they review it and you are approved, They send you a
                                 contract of what your 7eleven must do, Which as we all know  food-wise, You must -

                                <br> <br>
                                <div class="list">
                                    <i class="comment">sellPizza();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellTobaccoAndCigarettes();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellSlurpee();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellBusTickets();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellWings();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">keepTheFranchiseName();</i>
                                </div>

                                <br> <br>
                                Now as a prospective  7eleven owner, there are other guidelines obviously, this is just very high-level representation, you must implement all these, and you must follow that contract, now if you want, 
                                in your own 7 eleven you can decide to 

                                <br> <br>
                                <div class="list">
                                    <i class="comment">sellFuel();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellCOffee();</i>
                                    <i class="comment">sellExpiredDrinks();  -- just joking just joking </i>
                                    
                                </div>

                                but you must first obey the contract or else no agreement 

                                <br> <br>
                                so an interface a defines a contract that classes
                                 must adhere to when they implement the interface.
                                  Interfaces in Java are used to achieve abstraction and
                                   provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance 
                                since a class can implement multiple interfaces. 

                                <br> <br>

                                <h6>Let's create out List ADT(Franchise) using an interface </h6>
                                <br> <br>
                                A list should be able to -

                                <br> <br>

                                <div class="list">
                                    <i class="comment">-  To grow and shrink in size as we insert and remove elements.</i>
                                    <i class="comment">-  We should be able to insert and remove elements from anywhere in the list. ;</i>
                                    <i class="comment">- We should be able to gain access to any element’s value, either to read it or to change it.  </i>
                                    <i class="comment">- We must be able to create and clear (or reinitialize) lists. It is also convenient to access the next or previous element from the “current” one. 
                                    </i>
                                </div>
