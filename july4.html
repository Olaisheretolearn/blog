                                    A few months ago, my roommate left a passive-aggressive sticky note on the fridge because someone kept using his oat milk. 
                                    There are only two of us. And I’m allergic to oats.
                               <div class="datap">
                                <br> 
                                I laughed when I saw it, then got a little sad. Not because of the oat milk (though that stuff is expensive), 
                                but because that note felt like a summary of every shared living space I’ve been in: 
                                quiet frustrations, unspoken tensions, and the subtle art of avoiding direct conversations.

                                <br> <br>
                                 It reminded me of this boy I lived with during my first year. He always cleaned the bathroom without saying a word. Just did it. Every weekend. One day, I thanked him and he looked genuinely surprised, 
                                 like no one had ever noticed.
                                <br>  <br>
                                He said, <i>“Well, I figured someone should.”</i> <br> <br>

                                I asked him why he never asked anyone else to take turns. <br> <br> 
                                He shrugged. <i>“Don’t like fights.”</i> <br> <br>

                                And that was that. The guy scrubbed toilets in silence for an entire semester because the idea of saying “Can we rotate this?” felt heavier than cleaning <br>  <br>



Awa is a housemate app, but I think of it more like a soft place 
to land. It plays on the word “our” or even the Yoruba word for “us.” Something 
shared. Something mutual

                               Today I sketched out the entity models - Users, Rooms, Tasks, Bills, shoppingItem. I even drew up an ERD with crow’s foot notation, which made me feel oddly proud lmao

I also started the foundational steps of generating a zip file from start.spring.io, Figured out my  needed dependencies, connected my barebones to the MongoDB database cluster, kept my connection string in my environmental variable file

<br> <br>
I know I’m not the first person to try this. There are apps out there e.g Flatify, Dwell, a few others. But I’ve tried them, and honestly? They don’t feel built for real people. Flatify is clunky, overloaded with forms and dropdowns that make you feel like you’re doing admin work, not trying to live in peace. Dwell is cleaner, I’ll give it that. It has promise. But let’s see.

A friend of mine says they’ll handle the frontend in Flutter. They’ve promised, at least. We’ll see. I’m learning not to rush people when the work is unpaid and the vision still lives mostly in your head. But I’m hopeful.
